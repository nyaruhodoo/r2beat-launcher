                      GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 19 November 2007

   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free software license
   that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and
   modify the software. In addition, it ensures that the source code
   is available to everyone, and it protects your rights as an end
   user, including the right to run the software and share it with
   others.

   The AGPL was designed primarily for software that is used over a
   network, ensuring that any user who interacts with the software
   has access to the source code.  This is especially important for
   software that is deployed on web servers, where users may not have
   direct access to the software that powers the service they are
   using. This license also mandates that modified versions must
   provide the same freedoms to all users.

   This is a summary of the terms of the AGPL v3 license:
